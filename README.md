# THE Reason for it all
For this lab, students will be implementing part of an end-to-end platform to be used to control the state of electronic devices connected to the ESP32 module.

Students will be asked to write two separate applications, one to be used as an API that should be accessible over the internet and the other to used as an arduino sketch to be programmed on to ESP32 module.
